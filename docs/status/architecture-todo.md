# Architecture todo — agent runtime roadmap

Forward-looking themes for the Board Copilot agent runtime
(FastAPI + LangGraph + React SSE).

**Audience:** engineers extending Board Copilot v2.1 (FastAPI + LangGraph + React SSE).  
**Grounding:** structural backlog in [`../archive/agent-architecture-reviews.md`](../archive/agent-architecture-reviews.md), operational items in [`release-todo.md`](release-todo.md), product contract in [`../prd/v2.1-agent.md`](../prd/v2.1-agent.md).  
**Goal:** turn “streaming agents work” into **predictable contracts**, **recoverable sessions**, **fewer FE dual-paths**, and **production-grade intelligence/resilience** — without expanding scope into unrelated UX polish (see [`ui-todo.md`](ui-todo.md)).

## Current architecture (2026-05-10)

The Pulse backend ships six LangGraph-based agents (`board-brief`, `triage`, `task-drafting`, `task-estimation`, `chat`, `search`) behind two HTTP surfaces: the v1 deterministic JSON shim (`/api/ai/*`) and the v2.1 SSE surface (`/api/v1/agents/*`). The agent runtime owns idempotency, redaction, rate limiting, monthly token budgets, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Postgres-backed checkpointing. Six structural review phases shipped between 2026-05-08 and 2026-05-10 (see [`../archive/agent-architecture-reviews.md`](../archive/agent-architecture-reviews.md) for the measured outcome): events as first-class state, a `PolishStep` DSL replacing per-agent ad-hoc polish flows, model resolution decoupled from graph compilation via `Runtime[Context]`, a linear-pipeline scaffold for the five linear catalog agents and a shared HTTP-route factory, an explicit catalog manifest, and signed thread keys with rotation. Outstanding architectural gaps tracked below as Themes 5–6 (mutation lifecycle, provider gateway, real RAG, supervisor / shared subgraph, MCP) and operationally in [`release-todo.md`](release-todo.md) (GA Blocker §1, Beta Blockers §2/§3/§6, Soft Blocker §4, Polish §15–§16).

## Status — 2026-05-10 (PR #177 + two sweep re-audits)

The tractable single-day items across Themes 1, 2, and 4 shipped on `claude/complete-subagent-orchestrator-fUazo`. Specifically:

- **Theme 1:** per-surface Pydantic schemas with `extra="forbid"` (`backend/app/agents/events.py:48–155`), validation hook in the runtime (`validate_suggestion_payload` at `events.py:207–249`), and golden SSE transcript tests for all six agents (`backend/tests/test_agent_sse_transcripts.py`).
- **Theme 2:** normalized `AgentStatus` derived from existing hook state; `rateLimit` mid-stream envelopes now map to `AgentRateLimitError`.
- **Theme 4:** `threadId` persisted in `sessionStorage` per `(agent, projectId)` (`src/utils/hooks/useAgent.ts:203–206`); F-43 context migration (`project_id` / `user_id` / `autonomy_level` moved off `BaseAgentState` onto `ChatContext`).

Re-audit added 2026-05-10 (first sweep, on `claude/review-project-todos-8d5Oo`):

- **Theme 3** now explicitly tracks the `useAgent.ts` decomposition (1,010 lines today; verified `wc -l`) and the remaining autonomy metadata / settings follow-through after the `AiChatDrawer` selector shipped.
- **Theme 4** now tracks the multi-worker uvicorn unblock (Redis-backed rate-limit / budget / idempotency paths exist in `backend/app/middleware/redis_backends.py`, but env parity must be proven before the single-worker pin in `backend/Dockerfile:84` and `backend/fly.toml:38` is removed).
- **Theme 6** now tracks per-tenant model selection (the `X-Pulse-Model` runtime TODO at `backend/app/agents/runtime.py:578` — the only TODO left in the BE source tree).

Re-audit added 2026-05-10 (second sweep, on `claude/review-project-todos-7UKrJ`):

- All Theme 1–6 framings still match the implementation; the changes from this pass landed in [`ui-todo.md`](ui-todo.md) (stale `<a onClick>` and `CopilotAboutPopover` claims corrected) and in [`product-done.md`](product-done.md) (`taskCreator` / `columnCreator` accessibility shipped).
- BE TODO inventory: exactly one (`runtime.py:578`). FE TODO inventory: exactly two (`copilotAboutPopover/index.tsx:114` knowledge-cutoff config source; `aiChatDrawer/index.tsx:312` v3 autonomy gate). All three are tracked here or in `release-todo.md`.

Open: Theme 3 (FE surface simplification sweep, `useAgent` decomposition, autonomy capability gating / settings placement), Theme 5 (full mutation lifecycle), Theme 6 (provider gateway, vector store / RAG, `create_react_agent` migration, supervisor, MCP, per-tenant model). See [`release-todo.md`](release-todo.md) for the per-item severity / status.

## Priority stack (do this order)

1. **Contract hardening** — stale schemas silently break clients; cheapest wins are schema validation + version bumps + FE regression tests.
2. **Stream error handling** — users hit flakes before they hit missing features; classify failures and make retry/idempotency behavior consistent end-to-end.
3. **Mutation lifecycle closure** — proposals today are a GA risk (`MutationProposal` accept path must resume into a real tool + audit trail).
4. **Durable resume/state** — checkpoint/idempotency backends exist; **cross-tab reload**, **explicit resume UX**, and **LangGraph `Runtime[Context]` vs bloated state** complete the story.
5. **Frontend surface simplification** — reduce dual `useAi`/`useAgent` divergence where safe; stabilize hook dependencies and effect-driven starts (see repo `AGENTS.md`).
6. **Backend intelligence & resilience** — structured outputs, provider hedging, real RAG/embeddings, optional orchestration — **after** the stack above is trustworthy.

---

## Theme 1 — Contract hardening

**Gates:** Soft Blocker [§5](release-todo.md) (structured-output validation; partial fix shipped 2026-05-10, `create_react_agent(response_format=...)` migration remains).

| Action                                                                                                                                        | Rationale                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Define **Pydantic wire schemas** per agent output (`IBoardBrief`, drafts, estimate/readiness bundle, nudges) and validate before SSE emission | Matches review **F-10**; prevents silent JSON drift when LLMs replace stubs.                                     |
| Align **OpenAPI / agent metadata** with emitted events; bump **`AgentMetadata.version`** when payloads change                                 | Gives FE a supported deprecation window (PRD §5).                                                                |
| Single **error envelope** everywhere (`{"error": {"code","message"}}`); document legacy paths once and schedule removal                       | FE already dual-reads; narrow the compatibility surface over time.                                               |
| Contract tests: **golden SSE transcripts** (or snapshot parses) per agent in CI                                                               | Catches ordering/regression in `messages` / `custom/*` events without flaky LLM calls (deterministic stub mode). |

**Exit criteria:** Any breaking payload change fails CI or bumps agent version with an intentional FE companion PR.

---

## Theme 2 — Stream error handling

**Gates:** — (engineering quality; no direct release-tier dependency).

| Action                                                                                                                     | Rationale                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normalize **client-visible states**: connecting → streaming → interrupted → terminal (`completed` / `error` / `cancelled`) | Matches user mental model; simplifies drawers and analytics.                       |
| Map **HTTP/SSE failures** to existing typed errors (`budget`, `forbidden`, `rateLimit`, `server`) with stable `code`       | Already partially shipped; extend to mid-stream parse failures and proxy timeouts. |
| **Retry policy:** idempotent POST + `Idempotency-Key` on initial stream open; no double mutation on resume                 | Pairs with idempotency replay semantics on the server.                             |
| **Heartbeat / stall detection** on long interrupt waits (FE tool approval, network blips) with explicit user messaging     | Reduces “stuck spinner” reports on serverless edges.                               |

**Exit criteria:** Every failure mode has one UX affordance (retry, wait, contact admin, or disable AI) and matching telemetry reason codes.

---

## Theme 3 — Frontend surface simplification

**Gates:** GA Blocker [§1](release-todo.md) for the `MutationProposalCard` rollout-gate row only (FE flag stays off until §1 closes); Polish [§16b](release-todo.md) for the `useAgent.ts` decomposition; the rest is FE engineering hygiene.

| Action                                                                                                                            | Rationale                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Decompose `useAgent.ts` (1,010 lines).** Extract the SSE adapter, the FE-tool auto-resume loop, and the AC-V14 nudge inbox into separate hooks. | Single file owns SSE parsing, thread-id persistence, FE-tool resolution, TTFT, nudges, autonomy gate, and AI-disable guard — every change risks unrelated regressions. The nudge reducer is already exported as `reduceNudgeInbox`; finish the move. |
| **Isolate stable callbacks** from streaming identity churn in `useAgent` consumers (effects must not depend on whole hook return) | Documented anti-pattern in repo `AGENTS.md`; sweep chat, brief, assist panel, search.      |
| **Thin adapter layer** over SSE parser → domain events → UI state                                                                 | Limits duplicated parsing between `useAgent`, `useAgentChat`, and future shells.           |
| Reduce **`useAi` vs `useAgent`** divergence where behavior is identical (keep local-engine fallback, centralize switching)        | Lowers duplicate validators and bug surface; preserves `REACT_APP_AI_USE_LOCAL`.           |
| Guard `MutationProposalCard` and autonomy surfaces behind explicit env/capability checks until the backend lifecycle is real      | Already flagged in `AGENTS.md` / `release-todo.md` — formalize as a rollout gate. |
| **Finish autonomy capability gating.** `useAutonomyLevel` has persistence + cross-window sync and `AiChatDrawer` now exposes `suggest` / `plan` with `auto` disabled. Move the control into the broader settings surface when that ships and gate available values from backend `AgentMetadata.allowed_autonomy` instead of hardcoded FE options. | The user-visible picker exists, but the backend metadata that would keep it honest is still unused; future agents could advertise a different autonomy set without the UI adapting. |

**Exit criteria:** No component triggers duplicate agent `start()` loops on benign parent re-renders; structured routes share one parsing/validation path into React state.

---

## Theme 4 — Durable resume / state

**Gates:** Polish [§16d](release-todo.md) (single-worker uvicorn lock-in / Redis backends for rate-limit + budget). The F-43 sub-item already closed [§17](release-todo.md); the remaining items are reliability hygiene with no direct release-tier dependency.

| Action                                                                                                                   | Rationale                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Thread **`thread_id` / checkpoint** continuity across refresh and optional multi-tab policy (single writer vs broadcast) | Postgres checkpointing is useless if the FE always mints a fresh thread. |
| FE **persist minimal resume handles** (e.g., thread id, last interrupt id) scoped per project/user session               | Enables “Continue last agent turn” after accidental reload.              |
| Document **idempotency replay** vs **fresh stream** decision tree for support tooling                                    | Clarifies 409/422/`stream_completed` responses already on `/stream`.     |
| **Move rate-limit / budget / idempotency backends off in-memory** so uvicorn can run > 1 worker. The Redis backends already exist (`backend/app/middleware/redis_backends.py`); production-like envs must set `RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND=redis`, `BUDGET_BACKEND=redis`, and `IDEMPOTENCY_BACKEND=redis` before the single-worker pin is relaxed. Track in [release-todo §16d](release-todo.md). | Single-worker pin is an implicit scaling ceiling. Removing it requires env parity plus replay smoke tests before anyone bumps the worker count. |

**Exit criteria:** User can reload mid-interrupt and either resume cleanly or see an explicit “session expired” with recovery steps — never silent loss or duplicate apply.

---

## Theme 5 — Mutation lifecycle closure

**Gates:** GA Blocker [§1](release-todo.md) — this theme is the architectural plan that closes §1.

| Action                                                                                                                             | Rationale                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implement server **`custom/mutation_proposal`** emission + FE **`fe.applyMutation`** (or equivalent) interrupt contract end-to-end | Backlog explicitly tracks GA blocker in [`release-todo.md`](release-todo.md).                                            |
| Wire **accept/reject** to LangGraph **`Command(resume=…)`** with persisted proposal ids                                            | Ensures graph continues after human decision.                                                              |
| Add **audit log / analytics** for accepted mutations; define **server undo** semantics behind the 10s toast                       | FE-side `AGENT_PROPOSAL_UNDONE` now fires from `MutationProposalCard`; the open work is the BE accept/apply/undo lifecycle that makes the toast reversible end-to-end. |
| **Autonomy gates:** Suggest / Plan / Auto must map to enforceable server checks, not UI-only                                       | Aligns with PRD §6 and shadow-mode story.                                                                  |

**Exit criteria:** Acceptance tests cover full loop: proposal → approve → mutation applied → idempotent replay does not re-apply.

---

## Theme 6 — Backend intelligence & resilience

**Gates:** Beta Blocker [§2](release-todo.md) (provider gateway / failover), Soft Blocker [§4](release-todo.md) (real embeddings + vector store), Polish [§15](release-todo.md) (MCP mount), Polish [§16c](release-todo.md) (per-tenant model selection). The remaining sub-items (`create_react_agent` migration, supervisor / shared subgraph, memory namespaces) have no release-tier dependency.

| Action                                                                                                                        | Rationale                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Provider gateway:** LiteLLM/Portkey-style failover + hedged requests (**F-9**)                                              | Converts intermittent 5xx into degraded quality, not hard failure.               |
| **Real embeddings + vector store** (`pgvector` or managed) — retire SHA stub semantics for production ranking (**F-18/F-19**) | Unlocks search and estimation quality beyond FE candidate caps.                  |
| **`create_react_agent` migration** where appropriate (**F-12**)                                                               | Buys tool loops + structured output hooks consistently.                          |
| **Supervisor / shared subgraph** for duplicated drift logic (**F-13**)                                                        | Shrinks catalog maintenance cost — only after single-agent contracts are stable. |
| **Memory namespaces:** read/write paths for `user_preferences`, `project_profile`, etc. (**F-14**)                            | Optional Differentiator once observability proves safe use of store data.        |
| **MCP mount** (**F-15**)                                                                                                      | External integration track — parallel, not blocking core product loop.           |
| **Per-tenant model selection.** `backend/app/agents/runtime.py:578` carries a TODO to wire the `X-Pulse-Model` header to a per-tenant config. Today the header path is wired and gated by `AGENT_CHAT_MODEL_ALLOWLIST` (empty by default → header ignored), so this is **not** a security exposure — it's a missing product surface for design partners who want a non-default model. | Process-wide `AGENT_CHAT_MODEL_PROVIDER` env var is the only knob; design partners cannot opt their own project into a different model without redeploying. |

**Exit criteria:** Production config runs with non-stub embeddings dimensions, documented failover policy, and integration tests that hit gateway mocks / staged providers.

## Phased execution

| Phase                             | Scope                                                                                   | Dependencies                                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **A — Contract & errors**         | Schemas F-10, SSE/error normalization, golden transcripts, FE typed-error completeness  | None                                          |
| **B — Mutations & governance**    | Full `MutationProposal` lifecycle, audit, autonomy enforcement hooks                    | Phase A error + resume clarity                |
| **C — Resume & state hygiene**    | FE thread continuity; resume handles; refresh/tab policy                                | Phase B for mutation replay safety            |
| **D — FE simplification**         | Hook stabilization sweep, shared SSE adapter, reduce dual-path drift                    | Phases A–C reduce refactor churn              |
| **E — Intelligence & resilience** | Gateway F-9, vector store F-19, ReAct migration F-12, orchestration F-13/F-14, MCP F-15 | Stable contracts from A; durable state from C |

Workstreams **D** and parts of **E** can proceed in parallel once **A** lands; **B** should not start behind unvalidated schemas.

---

## Metrics (lightweight)

- **Contract:** % of agent responses passing schema validation in staging (target 100%).
- **Streams:** p95 time-to-first-token / interrupt-resolution latency; rate of unexplained client `reset()` calls.
- **Mutations:** proposals shown vs accepted vs failed resume (funnel).
- **Resilience:** provider 5xx → successful retry or fallback rate post-gateway.
